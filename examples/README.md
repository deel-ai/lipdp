# Tutorials

This folder contains two notebooks illustrating the usage of the library on Mnist and
 Cifar10 datasets.

The notebooks are self-contained and can be run as is.

The requirements are given in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Mnist

The notebook `basics_mnist.ipynb` is intended to be a quick start guide to the library.

## Cifar10

The notebook `advanced_cifar10.ipynb` is intended to show more advanced features of the library, such as residual connections and loss gradient clipping.
